    <h3>Pass the API Key with Every Request</h3>

    <p>You'll be passing your API key, issued to you when you're approved to use the API, with every request,
    as the parameter api_key.</p>

    <p>In addition, if you'd like to do things at the recipesOven.tk user level, like see your favorites or post a review on
    behalf of a user, you'll need to pass authentication information for that recipesOven user. That's different than your
    api_key; it's an encoded version of the user account information that you'll need to put in the request header.</p>

    <p>The authentication process for this user-level part of the recipesOven API is based on the HTTP Basic Access
    Authentication method defined by RFC 1945 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol â€“ HTTP/1.0).</p>
